**Requests to the Opindo server**

The plugin allows users and publishers to see the results on questions. These results are gathered from across the Opindo network, from as many publishers as host that particular question on their site. This provides users with the ability to see where they stand in relation to people beyond that specific readership. This means that the plugin must access information outside of the page on which it is hosted. To do this we need to send user responses on a plugin question to the Opindo server as well as sending requests to fetch the results from our database.


**Why Facebook login is needed on the plugin?**

Logging in with Facebook is required to ensure that each vote has integrity and that a user cannot simply refresh the page and vote again. In reference to sending requests to the Opindo server, once a user has logged in with Facebook they are not only unable to vote again on the question but also cannot repeat vote on the Opindo website or any other publisher that hosts that question. This also guarantees that the results also reflect a fair representation of user opinion. Furthermore the integrity of the vote is essential when taking results data to relevant decision-makers.
